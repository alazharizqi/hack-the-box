Hi team
after the great success of DoodleGrive, we are planning now to start working on our new project: "DoodleGrive self hosted",it will allow our customers to deploy their own documents sharing platform privately on thier servers...
However in addition with the "new self Hosted release" there should be a tool(doodleGrive-cli) to help the IT team in monitoring server status and fix errors that may happen.
As we mentioned in the last meeting the tool still in the development phase and we should test it properly...
We sent the username and the password in the email for every user to help us in testing the tool and make it better.
If you face any problem, please report it to the development team.
Best regards.
