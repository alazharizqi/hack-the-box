Hello guys,

Our dear Jocelyn received another phishing attempt last week and his habit of clicking on links without paying much attention may be problematic one day. That's why from now on, I've decided that important documents will only be sent internally, by mail, which should greatly limit the risks. If possible, use an .odt format, as documents saved in Office Word are not always well interpreted by Libreoffice.

PS: Last thing for Tom; I know you're working on our web proxy but if you could restrict access, it will be more secure until you have finished it. It seems to me that it should be possible to do so via <Limit>
